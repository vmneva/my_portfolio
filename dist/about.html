            <p>I am a fourth-year Software Engineering student at the University of Turku (M.Sc.). Alongside my studies, I work as Software Engineer
              Trainee in ATR Soft. I enjoy especially web programming and frontend development projects.
              My interest in web development is also reflected in my Bachelor's thesis, in which I wrote about the
              accessibility of websites. In the future, my goal is to become a professional in the software industry and
              develop my coding skills.

              <p>Thesis identifies web accessibility issues encountered by visually impaired users through a literature review.
                It also explores how issues are managed and whether following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
                is sufficient to address them. Thesis shows that although WCAG guidelines address some problems, additional
                consideration of cognitive aspects and visual layout is necessary to ensure an accessible user experience for visually
                impaired users.

              <p>During this summer trainee period, I worked in SaaS team. We finished an old project which was skill management software.
                In addition, we started new SaaS round with creating ideas and planning. Finally two ideas were chosen and started to
                develop simultaneously. My responsibilities included for example fullstack development and database management.
